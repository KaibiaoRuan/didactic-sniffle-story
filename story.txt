Hello everyone, here is Mike and he is on his way to the school. However, it seems like he just realized that he forgot his notes at home.

Mike contemplates returning home to grab his notes, but class already starts in 5 minutes. There is no way that he would be able to get home in time to grab his notes without coming to class tardy. Mike decides to go to class without his note...
It is very hard to attend class without notes. Mike decides to take notes with his laptop. But laptop also does not work.

Mike feels so angry that things are not going too well for me, as he looked around to find a seat, he accidentally saw someone at the corner 
of the lecture holding his very notebook.And Immediately, he realized something went horribly wrong as his notebook has some secret. 

So, he went over and ask the guy, but to find out that it's not his notebook. However, he was lucky as that person offerred to show him the notes so he won't get lost in the class
